# Liri-node-app

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line Node application that takes in parameters (via command line arguments or file input) to search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
